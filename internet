# Internet 

A wire buried in the ground 
- fibre optics
- copper 
- satellite
- cell phone networks

Servers are special computers connected directly to the internet

Webpages are files in a server's hard drive 

Every server has a unique IP address to help computers find each other 

Home computers are indirectly connected via a ISP (internet service provider)

Email : Client -> ISP -> Internet -> Server -> Other server -> Receiver 

Data across the internet are sent through packets (sent in small parts and are pieced back at destination)

Intersection of any parts of the internet -> Router 
Routers wrap the packets in layers so that info can be sent back by unwrapping to find out where to send.
